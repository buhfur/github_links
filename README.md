# Github links 

This is a tool I used Chatgpt to make, it's supposed to pull all github links from a web page so that I may use them in an addon downloader. 


# Running 

In the "github\_links/spiders" directory run :

`python3 -m scrapy crawl github_spider `


All found links will be put into a text document "github\_links.txt"
